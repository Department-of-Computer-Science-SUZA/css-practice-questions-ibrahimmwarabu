  <p>Coffee is a brewed drink with a distinct aroma and flavor,<br>
     prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds found inside "berries" of the Coffea plant.<br>
      Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in equatorial Latin America, Southeast Asia, <br>
      India and Africa. The two most commonly grown are the highly regarded arabica,<br>
       and the less sophisticated but stronger and more hardy robusta. The latter is resistant to the coffee leaf rust,<br>
        Hemileia vastatrix, but has a more bitter taste. Once ripe, coffee beans are picked, processed, and dried.<br>
         Green (unroasted) coffee beans are one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world. Once traded, <br>
         the beans are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor, <br>
         before being ground and brewed to create coffee.<br>
          Coffee is slightly acidic and can have a stimulating effect on humans because of its caffeine content.<br>
           It is one of the most popular drinks in the world. It can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways.<br>
            The effect of coffee on human health has been a subject of many studies; however,<br>
             results have varied in terms of coffee's relative benefit. <br>
             The majority of recent research suggests that moderate coffee consumption <br>
             is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults. However, <br.
             the diterpenes in coffee may increase the risk of heart disease.</p>
